        The world resolves into a single, dust-choked snapshot. A fine grey powder coats everything, clinging to eyelashes and filling the air with a hazy filter. 
        The dark, wide orbits of the child's eyes are the only clear feature on a face mapped with grime and the pale tracks of dried tears.
        Their gaze is fixed, unblinking, staring at a landscape where the familiar geometry of homes has been broken into jagged, unrecognizable shapes.
        There is a visible tremor in a small, grimy hand resting on the ground.
        The view captures the stark contrast of a single, brightly colored shoe, half-buried in the monochrome rubble a final, brutal punctuation mark on a stolen childhood.
